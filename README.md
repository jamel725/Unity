# Unity
This is a simple fruit clicker game made using Unity
I created this game completely by myself by learning from resources available online
Through this project I discovered my passion for game design and development
I really enjoy video games and this experience motivated me even more to become a game developer

While building this game I learned and understood many important concepts in Unity including game objects UI collision and scripting
This is just the beginning and I believe I have great potential to keep learning and developing even more complex and fun games in the future
